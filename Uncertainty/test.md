# Uncertainty
The idea behind **uncertainty** is that the outcome of events can be predicted but there is not garuntee that the predicted outcome will always occur, we always have some level of **uncertainty** in whether our predictions will be reflected by reality.

> [!Definition]
> Uncertainty is a measure that relates to how a *predicted value may differ from the observed value*.

## Purpose and Properties
Uncertainty can be used to assess the reliability of predictions

## Examples of Uncertainty Measures
- Standard deviation
- IQR

# Expected Value
Expected value is a central tendency measure (determines what is the average or typical value in a dataset). Expected value can help quantify risk and aid in decision making.

> [!Definition]
> Expected value is the *expected outcome* based on some *repeated trial* of a statistical experiment. 

## Formula
Expected value is the sum of all possible products of the value associated with a statistical outcome and its respective probability

## Example
Suppose you are rolling a fair six-sided die, and you want to calculate the expected value of the roll. The possible outcomes are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, each with equal probability of 1/6. What is the expected value in this scenario?

To calculate the expected value, you can use the above formula:

Expected Value = (Outcome 1 x Probability 1) + (Outcome 2 x Probability 2) + ... + (Outcome n x Probability n)

Expected Value = (1 x 1/6) + (2 x 1/6) + (3 x 1/6) + (4 x 1/6) + (5 x 1/6) + (6 x 1/6)

Expected Value = 3.5
